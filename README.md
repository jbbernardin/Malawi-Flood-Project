# Malawi-Flood-Project
Using predictive modeling, determine flooding in Malawi using 2015 data to train and 2019 data to test

So far have a model that fits the train data with an r^2 value of higher than 97%, but it does not fit the test data particularly well. This is definitely an overfitted model,
so if you guys want to play around with it in a new branch to try and improve the model that would be much appreciated.
