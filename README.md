# Malawi-Flood-Project
Using predictive modeling, determine flooding in Malawi using 2015 data to train and 2019 data to test

So far have a model that fits the train data with an r^2 value of higher than 97%, so I don;t recommend making changes to the main branch unless you find
while working in a different branch that this model overfits/doesn't account for something.
